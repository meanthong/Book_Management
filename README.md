This is my project to provide an easy way to manage books in a library.
It simulates the process of library's books management, including:
    *Making the process of loaning and returning books very easy for Librarian.
    *Focusing on the administrator and can be only accessed by the administrator to manage the database of the books. 
    *Keeping track of the loaned and returned books using binary file to save data.
The project using Linked-list to manage books, one book as one node. A book(node) inlcude some example main information(ID, Name, Author).
